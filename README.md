# CS103a CPA02

## What's this app? 
This app is built on the structure of CS103a course selection app (PA03). It allows users to anonymously evaluate the courses they've taken. Users can rate the course in a scale from 0 to 5, and type in comment to elaborate their experience. This app displays a list of courses that've been evaluated with an average rating and all the collected comments. This is created to help students select their future courses based on the feedback from others.
